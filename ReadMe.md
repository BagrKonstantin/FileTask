*Filer* is an amazing app for people who want to deal with
merging files, but don't want to catch infinite loop due  
to cycle dependency or catch IOException due to incorrect 
filepath or lack of writing or reading rights.

We solve these annoying problems with our app.

You should enter absolute path to the directory with 
files you want to process and then enter path to file 
you want to write merged data in
